        <p>"After a minute she said, 'I have no feet. I am unaware that I have any  feet. And my knees are cold. I can scarcely feel that I have knees.'</br>"She lay on the floor, a bundle of notebooks under her head. And we  could do nothing. The coldness and the numbness crept up past her hips  to her heart, and when it reached her heart she was dead. In fifteen  minutes, by the clock&mdash;I timed it&mdash;she was dead, there, in my own  classroom, dead. And she was a very beautiful, strong, healthy young  woman. And from the first sign of the plague to her death only fifteen  minutes elapsed. That will show you how swift was the Scarlet Death.</p>

        <p>"Something seems to have gone wrong either with our calculations or the chronometer," I said.  Perry shook his head&mdash;there was a strange expression in his eyes.</br>"Let's have a look beyond that door, David," he cried.</br>Together we stepped out to stand in silent contemplation of a landscape at once weird and beautiful.
